# NTT Ltd. Front-End Challenge

Hello Dev, I am happy to see you here and I wish you the best luck.

This is a UX/UI challenge that uses json-server as a backend to provide the necessary data. 

# What you can use

You may use any of the technologies below:

- React
- Angular
- AngularJS
- VueJS
- Next.js (but it is basically React, right?)
- Bootstrap
- Angular Material
- Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript

If you want to use any technology that is not listed here you may contact the Recruiter in charge of your proccess.

# System Requirements

To run this project you only need to install Node.js at it's currently LTS version.

You can not delete the files db.json and package.json.

# How to run the backend

First of all you should install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And to start the json-server you only need to run the command below at your terminal:


```bash
npm run backend
```

# What you should do

The main objective of this Challenge is to evaluate your creativity to resolve UX problems. In this repo you have a db.json containing a lot of user information that should be displayed at a screen. The first solution everyone thinks about is to create a table containing all the information, however the table is the solution that you should **avoid** *(that doesnt mean that you can not use)*. 

You should create a front-end containing the following functionalities:
- Visualization of all the users,
- Functionality to edit any user,
- Functionality to delete any user,
- Functionality to create new users.

Basically a CRUD.

That front-end should have the best usability you can create.
